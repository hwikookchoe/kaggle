For ensembling the 4 base models, I tried to use Generalized Ensemble Model (GEM), proposed by  [Perrone and Cooper (1992)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=When%20networks%20disagree%3A%20Ensemble%20methods%20for%20hybrid%20neural%20networks&author=M.P.%20Perrone&publication_year=1992), in order to find optimal weights in terms of MSE or RMSE. However, the optimal weights calculated by GEM algorithm suggested that Logit-only model predicted the best (in terms of MSE/RMSE). What is even more interesting is that the optimal weight does not maximize ROC score. Thus, although I calculated optimal weights using GEM algorithm, I assigned arbitrary weights for my final ensemble model.\n","\n","Calculating optimal weight based on maximizing ROC AUC score seems impossible (is it possible?), since the score is not differentiable. Some approaches use alternative measure, such as binary cross entropy(BCE). There are other approaches that resemble the behavior of ROC AUC score and are differentiable (and are possible to make as quadratic form, which have single global max/min), such as [ROC-star](https://github.com/iridiumblue/roc-star). I'm going to implement BCE and ROC-star later.\n","\n","Improved algorithm, Generalized Ensemble Model with internally tuned hyperparameters (GEM-ITH) is proposed by [Shahhosseini, Hu and Pham (2022)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C14&q=Optimizing+ensemble+weights+and+hyperparameters+of+machine+learning+models+for+regression+problems&btnG=), which suggests tuning not only the weights of base models but also the hyperparameters of each base model inside the loop. I did not implement this work, and do not intend to do it."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"fb95d31a","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.010742,"end_time":"2022-08-15T21:48:22.977635","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-08-15T21:48:22.966893","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["## 0.
